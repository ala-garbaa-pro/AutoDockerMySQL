# Database Management Shell Script

This is a shell script that allows you to perform various actions on a database using automation with Docker. The script provides an easy-to-use command-line interface to interact with the database.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure that you have Docker installed on your system and the necessary Docker images or containers for the database you want to manage.

## Usage

To use this script, follow the instructions below:

```bash
./database.sh [ACTION] [PATH]
```

Replace `[ACTION]` with one of the following options:

- `c` or `create`: Create a new database.
- `e` or `export`: Export the database.
- `i` or `import`: Import the database from the file specified in `[PATH]`.
- `d` or `delete`: Delete an existing database.
- `r` or `recreate`: Delete the existing database and create a new one.
- `p` or `print_uri`: Print the database URI.
- `ch` or `check`: Check the database connection.

## Actions

### Create a New Database

To create a new database, run the following command:

```bash
./database.sh create
```

### Export the Database

To export the database, use the following command:

```bash
./database.sh export
```

### Import the Database

To import the database from a specific file, provide the file `PATH` as follows:

```bash
./database.sh import PATH
```

Replace `PATH` with the path to the file containing the database you want to import.

### Delete an Existing Database

To delete an existing database, use the following command:

```bash
./database.sh delete
```

### Delete and Recreate Database

To delete the existing database and create a new one, use the following command:

```bash
./database.sh recreate
```

### Print Database URI

To print the database URI, use the following command:

```bash
./database.sh print_uri
```

### Check Database Connection

To check the database connection, use the following command:

```bash
./database.sh check
```

## Examples

1. Create a new database:

```bash
./database.sh create
```

2. Export the database:

```bash
./database.sh export
```

3. Import the database from a file:

```bash
./database.sh import /path/to/database_file.sql
```

4. Delete an existing database:

```bash
./database.sh delete
```

5. Delete the existing database and create a new one:

```bash
./database.sh recreate
```

6. Print the database URI:

```bash
./database.sh print_uri
```

7. Check the database connection:

```bash
./database.sh check
```

## Note

- Make sure to adjust the script according to your specific database configuration and Docker setup.
- Use the script at your own risk, and ensure you have proper backups before performing any destructive actions.
